I'm a physical chemist with expertise in ultrafast spectroscopy and machine learning interested in leveraging my skills to accelerate the development of materials for renewable energy and quantum information science. Most recently, I completed postdoctoral research at Brookhaven National Laboratory where I arrived after earning my PhD in physical chemistry at Northwestern University. I did my undergraduate degree in chemistry at Columbia University.

I am passionate about pursuing research that will lead to a sustainable future for our society. I am equally invested in making STEM research an inclusive place, and I have mentored many younger scientists with intentionality and care to help them reach their professional goals. 

Currently, I'm open to research collaborations and offer consultations that draw on my background in molecular science and machine learning. You can [schedule a call](https://supercal.com/michelemyong) with me to learn more about my teaching and consultation offerings.
