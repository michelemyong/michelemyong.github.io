I am an experimental physical chemist working on problems in solar energy conversion and quantum information science. I am interested in leveraging both my spectroscopy and machine learning experience to accelerate the development of materials for renewable energy, bridging the gap between experimental and computational science. Most recently, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Brookhaven National Laboratory, where I came after earning my PhD in physical chemistry at Northwestern University.

My expertise is in harnessing ultrafast spectroscopy (including transient absorption and electron accelerators) to study energy and charge transfer in chemical systems for renewable energy. I am also skilled in synthesizing the materials that I want to study, which range from molecules to self-assembled materials. Recently, I have been working on using machine learning to predict the properties of new molecules that can speed up the development of chemicals for quantum information science, solar energy, and photocatalysis.  

Inclusion in science is very important to me, and I have many experiences mentoring and teaching younger researchers to help them achieve their goals. Building community is key to improving the way we do science, and I have created many initiatives such as seminars and study groups to bring people together to work towards a common goal.

I am excited to leverage my technical, communication, and leadership skills to advance discoveries that will lead to a sustainable future for our society. If you are interested in discussing potential research collaborations or my teaching services, please feel free to contact me via email.
