I am an experimental chemist working on problems in solar energy conversion and quantum information science. I am interested in leveraging both my spectroscopy and machine learning experience to accelerate the development of materials for renewable energy, bridging the gap between experimental and computational science.

My expertise is in harnessing ultrafast spectroscopy to study energy and charge transfer in chemical systems for renewable energy. I am also skilled in synthesizing the materials that I want to study, which range from molecules to self-assembled materials.

Recently, I have been working on using machine learning to predict the properties of new molecules that can speed up the development of chemicals for quantum information science, solar energy, and photocatalysis. I am passionate about using my experimental and computational skills to advance discoveries that can lead to a sustainable future for our society.
