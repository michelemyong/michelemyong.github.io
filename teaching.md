I have numerous experiences teaching chemistry in classrooms, lab settings, and smaller recitation sections. From these experiences, I have developed my own teaching philosophy that focuses on growing students' "chemical intution" which is a skill built on understanding chemistry as a living framework with patterns and related concepts. From this perspective, I aim to demystify "chemical intuition" by helping students to internalize concepts by making the material meaningful and relevant to them, as well as developing their critical thinking skills by empowering them in the learning process. This allows students to take intellectual risks, which strengthens their confidence in problem solving and ability to learn more advanced concepts. 

I have mentored younger scientists by helping them with their graduate school applications and offering my perspective and experience when it comes to navigating their own academic journeys. As I have written numerous fellowship and grant proposals, I also edit and critically evaluate research ideas that mentees and colleagues submit for funding. 

I offer tutoring and consulting services, drawing on my expertise in molecular science (physics, chemistry, math) and machine learning. If you are interested in working with me, please schedule a call with me at the following link.
